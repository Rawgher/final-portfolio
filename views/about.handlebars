            Hi, I'm Roger. I graduated from UC Davis in 2014 with a Bachelor's Degree in Animal Biology. I'm
            currently located in Northern
            California, but I spent the majority of my life down in Los Angeles.
        </p>

            I'm a nerdy kid who enjoys comics, spending a lot of time on Netflix and browsing Reddit. I spend
            too much time bothering
            and taking pictures of my two cats. I've worked with different species of animals during all sorts
            of
            jobs, and had always thought I would keep working with them, until I discovered coding.
        </p>

            I really love building stuff from scratch and am looking forward to seeing all the different ways I
            can do that. Please check
            out my portfolio below if you have some time. I will be updating it with my boot camp projects, and
            any
            side projects I have been working on. Please contact me if there are any projects I can help you
            with.
