                    Hi, I'm Roger. I graduated from UC Davis in 2014 with a Bachelor's Degree in Animal Biology. I'm currently located in Northern
                    California, but I spent the majority of my life down in Los Angeles.

                    I'm a nerdy kid who enjoys comics, spending a lot of time on Netflix and browsing Reddit. I spend too much time bothering
                    and taking pictures of my two cats. I've worked with different species of animals during all sorts of
                    jobs, and had always thought I would keep working with them, until I discovered coding.
                </p>

                    I really love building stuff from scratch and am looking forward to seeing all the different ways I can do that. Please check
                    out my portfolio below if you have some time. I will be updating it with my boot camp projects, and any
                    side projects I have been working on. Please contact me if there are any projects I can help you with.
